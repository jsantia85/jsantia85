## About Me
Salutations! I'm Juan Santiago and this is my GitHub Profile. I'm a former social scientist and educator turned software engineerâ€”a NJ native with a passion for learning and problem solving, driven by constant self-improvement. Independent and team-oriented, I enjoy working in environments that allow me to use my diverse skill set and foster genuine and authentic relationships with those around me.
